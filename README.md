Features

Source Coding: Huffman encoding and decoding for efficient data compression.

Channel Coding:

Hamming (7,4) encoding and decoding for error correction.

Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) for error detection.

Error Injection: Simulates transmission errors at a user-defined rate.

Quantitative Analysis:

Compression ratio.

Bit Error Rate (BER) before and after correction.

Computational complexity analysis.

Predictor Calculation: Uses a neighbor-based predictor for spatial redundancy reduction.

GUI:

Load or create hyperspectral images.

Select error correction parameters (e.g., CRC usage, error rate).

Visualize the original, compressed, and decompressed images.

Visualization: Graphically compare original, compressed, and decompressed images for the first five bands.
